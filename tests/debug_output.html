        <h1>How Planetary Fields Entangle with Your Body's Energy Blueprint</h1>

        <p>Holistic well-being begins with a preventive approach to health, urging us not to wait until disease
            manifests. Your food choices play a pivotal role in shaping your body’s health, but it’s not just what you
            eat; your thoughts and emotional state significantly influence your well-being.</p>

        <p>Your body is interconnected to the environment surrounding you, from the obvious impacts of diet and
            lifestyle to even the more subtle influences like planetary gravitational pulls. We are most familiar with
            how the lunar cycle affects human behavior and physiology. The other planets in the solar system exert their
            influence in more subtle ways, affecting our energetic body.</p>

        <p>Our etheric body, our subtle energy counterpart of the physical body, possesses a series of force centers
            (nerves plexus) or chakras that receive the energy of the planets. According to Eastern teachings, the
            energy we receive from the Trinity passes from these subtle centers into our physical body by means of
            invisible circuits called nadis (Savitri, Hindu text) or meridians (TCM).</p>

        <p>All ailments are caused because our magnetic field doesn’t pull enough energy from the air we breathe into
            the lungs to supply the different parts of the body, so when weaker areas are not supplied with their
            energy, abnormal function results.</p>

        <p>Your astral chart reflects your own energy pattern to offer insights into your state of health, pinpoint
            nutritional deficiencies, and gauge your psychological balance.</p>

        <p>The condition and placement of planets in your chart can indicate potential health issues based on their
            dignity and avasthas, as well as the zodiac sign, they occupy. However, it's important to note that not all
            symptoms or diseases are certain to manifest, and their occurrence may vary throughout different stages of
            life corresponding to planetary periods (dasas/profections) and transits.</p>

        <p>When multiple planets highlight a particular ailment, the likelihood of its manifestation increases.</p>

        <p>Nonetheless, health astrology operates akin to a personalized weather forecast, offering insights for
            preventive measures rather than definitive predictions. Just as one prepares for possible rain by carrying
            an umbrella, understanding one's astrological health indicators facilitates proactive healthcare strategies
            aimed at prevention.</p>

    <!-- The Elements -->
    <div>
        <h1>The Elements</h1>

        <p>The four elements Fire Earth Water and Air can help you to pinpoint some obvious and easy ways to correct
            factors that affect health. Too much or not enough of an element can contribute to weakness in various parts
            of the body. By compensating for a lack of or an emphasis on an element one can alter the imbalance and
            improve health.</p>

        <p>Fire Earth Water and Air elements are the building-blocks of our physical as well as of our psychological
            functioning and we find them also in natural substances like herbs, and nutrition. This is the reason why
            understanding your health energetic blueprint makes healing possible.</p>

        <p>The Four Humors (Hippocrates, Galen) are the metabolic agents of the Four Elements in the human body. The
            right balance and purity of them is essential to maintaining health.</p>

        <div class="blue-center">An excess of a humor may lead to a great diversity of symptoms and diseases with the
            problem manifesting through the weakest point of the individual client.</div>

        <p>Every humor or element is a combination of two qualities: TEMPERATURE & MOISTURE. These concepts apply both
            physically and psychologically.</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>FIRE</strong></td>
                <td><strong>HOT AND DRY</strong></td>
                <td>Heat: energy life impulse motive movement energy is spent and body cools down</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>AIR</strong></td>
                <td><strong>HOT AND MOIST</strong></td>
                <td>Coolness; malfunction, not enough energy for metabolic processes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>EARTH</strong></td>
                <td><strong>COLD AND DRY</strong></td>
                <td>Dryness: maintains form and creates boundaries</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>WATER</strong></td>
                <td><strong>COLD AND MOIST</strong></td>
                <td>Moisture: cool conditions attract moisture, connects and softens</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Because heat and cold are the primary characteristics, the placement on the scale of hot/cold is most
            important.</p>

        <p>An organism that is cold has to be heated and one that is too hot has to be cooled down. In practice we will
            use mainly foods of a humoral nature, contrary to the excess humor (the principle of antipathy). Also some
            foods can be eaten which have the temperature as the healing element but not the same degree of moisture/
            dryness.</p>

        <p>If the problem is excess water it is best to avoid all cold and moist foods and eat as much as you can from
            those foods listed under hot and dry. But some foods under hot and moist can be eaten too. These foods will
            heat the body up, and more heat always means less moisture. The secondary axis the moisture/dryness rate
            depends on the heat/cold axis to a certain extent.</p>

        <p>Lastly, herbs should work against the humoral excess that causes the disease; this is the most important
            thing. The exact herb that you need will be determined by the planetary positions in your chart. Also, they
            have to be taken at the right planetary hour for better results.</p>
